freeCodeCamp.org offers several developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of coding challenges and this repository contains my solution to all of those coding challenges and web app projects. freeCodeCamp estimate that each certification generally takes approx. 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 30 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help users build up project incrementally and ensure fulfillment of all the user stories before submission.
