# Basics

1. **Reserved Words** = words you cannot use as variable names
```
False, None, True, and, as, assert, break, class, if, def, del, elif, else, except, 
return, for, from, global, try, import, in, is, lambda, while, not, or, pass, raise, 
finally, continue, nonlocal, with, yield.
```
2. **Constants** = fixed values, do not change. Numbers, letters, or strings. String constants use single or double quotes(',")
3. **Variables** = a name placed in memory to store and retrieve data. All variables must start with a letter or underscrore (but starting with an underscore is a bad idea). After the first letter varioables can have letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case sensitive, but differentiating with only difference is capitalization is confusing. 
4. **Numeric Expressions**
```
+ Addition, - Subtraction, * Multiplication, / Division, 
** Power, % Remainder, = assigns variable
```
```
< less than, <= less than or equal to, > greater than, 
== equal to, != not equal
```
5. **Type**: intiger(int), float, or string(str). Can only combine things of the same type. You can ask python which type a variable is. You can convert between different types. Divition will always result in a floating type. 
6. **Indentation**: very important for if/while statements. You will get an error if the indentation is not correct. You cannot replace tabs for spaces. There is no 'end' command as in Matlab, so the indentation is how Python knows to exit a loop
7. **Try/except Structure** = If you know there is a line of code which will most likely give back an error, sorround it in a try/except loop. If the try works, except is skipped. If try fails, except is run. Normally the error would stop the entie code, but this allows the rest of the code to continue running. 
8. **Functions**: Coders dont like to retype the same thing twice. This is for ease of debugging or changing. If you find something wrong in one place you now need to go find it 10 more times unless it is saved as a function. `def` creates, names, and records the function. To run the code you later call it by name(). It is best practice to output functions with return() command instead of print().
9. **Arguments** = value passed into the function as an input when you call the function
10. **Parameters** = a variable used in the function definition
11. **Pyhon commands**: 
```
break = stops the exicution of a loop
return = stops the exicution of a function and speecifies output
```
